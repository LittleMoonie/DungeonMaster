👥 The Characters:
You'll acquaire characters higher up you go in the Tower. There are a total of 6 heros to acquaire all with different classes. 3 are unlocked at the start of the game and the other 3 are unlocked as you progress through the game. Each character has a unique set of stats that will help you in your journey.

🌟 The Gameplay:
The gameplay should be fun, intuitive, and challenging. Filled with turn by turn fighting and strategic decision-making.

🎨 The Art:
The art of the game should be visually appealing and immersive. Consider the style, color palette, and design of the characters, monsters, and environments to create a cohesive and exciting world for the player to explore.

🎵 The Sound:
The sound and music of the game should enhance the player's experience and create an immersive atmosphere. Think about the sound effects for battles and obstacles, as well as the music for each level to create a dynamic and exciting game.

📈 The Progression:
The game should have a sense of progression, where the player is rewarded for their efforts and advances further into the tower. Consider adding items to help the player along the way.

Now that you know the basics, it's time to get started on your RPG game development journey! Think about the design and mechanics of the game, create the characters and monsters, and start programming. Remember, the most important thing is to have fun and be creative!
